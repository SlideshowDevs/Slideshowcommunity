        <p>Welcome to Slideshow Network!<br> 
		   Here we provide modpacks and servers for our very own modpacks!<br> 
		   We are a small community and we will like your help to expand to the future, by just joining our discord and even playing one of our packs will help us a lot
		   and it will encourage us to continue develop modpacks for your very own enjoyment.<br>
		   So you just read all that and thats it? Yes we only just made this website and we are still working on it, you can click one of 4 buttons
		   we have at this moment, you can click discord for some information about our discord and what we do there, you can also click modpacks to see what modpacks we have to offer and if they have a server
		   or if you have a good heart you may wish to click the social media button to look into some of our social media and even support us by donating so we can keep the servers and this website up and
		   running!</p>
